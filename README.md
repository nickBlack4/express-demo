# express-demo

This app utilizes the Express framework.  Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

In this app, we also use Joi for input validation.  An important note is that Joi has changed to @hapi/joi npmjs.com/package/@hapi/joi

Full CRUD has been implemented in the app and can be tested easily with Postman.  https://www.getpostman.com/
